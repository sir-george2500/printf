The printf function sends formatted output to the standard output stream (usually the console). For educational purposes, students from cohort #17, namely George S Mulbah II and Deborah Sunday, developed a custom function named _printf().

The _printf() function works with a format string, which is a character string enclosed within single or double quotation marks. The format string is where you define how the output should be formatted and where placeholders for values are marked using the percentage '%' operator.

This custom _printf() function is designed to replicate the basic functionality of the standard printf() function, providing an opportunity for learning about string formatting and manipulation in C programming.
